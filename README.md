ENS Open Ledger is a quarterly/annual visualization of the ENS Accounting Book in the form of a Sankey diagram. The application collects data from the chain, processes it, renders and visualizes it. The working application is available at [ens-ledger.app](ens-ledger.app). More information about the application structure can be found [here](https://github.com/danchousz/ens_open_ledger/blob/main/project_structure.md).
